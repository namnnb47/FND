the 2020 election season enters its final stretch. A phrase claiming to come from President Donald Trump that circulated in October 2015 is making the rounds again on social media platforms. The article, allegedly published Oct. 27, 2015, claims Trump, while in Indianapolis, said African Americans are \"lazy.\" The story does not reference a date or context for Trump speaking in that city. The social media post contains what appears to be a picture of the print version of the article, which has \"Africans Are Lazy, Good At Sex, Theft\", as a headline, above a photo of Trump. The article quotes Trump as referring to Africans and African Americans interchangeably.
